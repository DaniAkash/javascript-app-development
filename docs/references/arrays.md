An array is a global object that can hold a list of elements of any data type and access them by a single variable.

### Array Declaration
There are basically two ways to declare an array.
- With the literal notation `[ ]`
```
let myHobbies = ["Dancing","Singing","Programming","Cooking","Writing"]
```
- With the array `constructor`
```
let shirtSize = new Array(34,36,38,40,42,44,46)
```
### Array Methods
### push()
### pop()
### shift()
### unshift()
### reverse()
### find()
It is used to create a new object based on the condition you set. On the surface, it looks like filter() but theyâ€™re not the same. filter() returns an array of matched objects while find() will return the first matched object.
```

```
### every()
### concat()
### slice()
### splice()
### filter()
It is a method that lets you create a new array based on conditions that evaluate to true from an existing array.
```
const marks = [85,76,93,88,95,79]
const filteredMarks = marks.filter(mark =>{
    return mark>80
})
console.log(filteredMarks) // [85,93,88,95]
```
### map()
### reduce()

### Summary of commonly used array methods

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| push(...items) | Inserts an element at the end |
| pop() | Removes an element at the end and returns it |
| shift() | Removes the first element |
| unshift(..items) | Inserts an element at the beginning |
| forEach(func) | Calls a function for each element in the array |
| filter(func) | Creates a new array based on conditions that evaluate to true from an exisiting array |
| map(func) |  Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array |
| reduce(func,initial) | Apply a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) as to reduce it to a single value |
| concat(...items) | Creates a new array containing all the elements in the original array followed by the each of the arrays that are passed in |
| slice(start,end) | Extracts a section of an array and returns a new array excluding the end position |
| splice(pos,n,...items) | At index pos, delete 'n' elements and insert items |
| find(func) | Returns the first matched object |
| every(func) | Returns a boolean value true or false value based on the conditions set |
| some(func) | Returns true if at least one of the condition evaluates to true |
| reverse() | Reverses the array in-place and returns it |
| join(optional seperator)| Concatenates all the members of an array into a string, along with a separator |
| toString() | Joins an array together into a string by comma separator |
