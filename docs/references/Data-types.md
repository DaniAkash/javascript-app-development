JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript:
Primitive values
Non-primitive values (object references)
Data types that are known as primitive values in JavaScript are numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined. Objects such as functions and arrays are referred to as non-primitive values.
The fundamental difference between primitives and non-primitives is that primitives are immutable and non-primitives are mutable.
Primitives are known as being immutable data types because there is no way to change a primitive value once it gets created.
