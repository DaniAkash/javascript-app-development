Anything that can store data can be called as a data structure. 
we can classify datastructures into two types,

1. **Primitive Data Structure**
2. **Abstract Data Structure**

### Primitive Data Structure

Primitive data structures are predefined way of storing data by the system. And the set of operations that can be performed on these data are also predefined. It can be called simply _Basic data types_.
For example,
- `Integer` 
- `Float` 
- `Boolean` 
- `Char` 

### Abstract Data Structure

We also have some complex Data Structures, which are used to store large and connected data. Some example of  are :
- `Stack` 
- `Queue`
- `Linked List`
- `Tree`
- `Graph` _etc_.

The data structures can also be classified on the basis of the following characteristics:
| Characterstic | Explanation |
| ------ | ------ |
| Linear | In Linear data structures,the data items are arranged in a linear sequence. Example: **Array** |
| Non-Linear	 | In Non-Linear data structures,the data items are not in sequence. Example: **Tree, Graph** |
| Homogeneous | In homogeneous data structures,all the elements are of same type. Example: **Array** |
| Non-Homogeneous	 | In Non-Homogeneous data structure, the elements may or may not be of the same type. Example: **Structures** |
| Static | Static data structures are those whose sizes and structures associated memory locations are fixed, at compile time. Example: **Array** |
| Dynamic | Dynamic structures are those which expands or shrinks depending upon the program need and its execution. Also, their associated memory locations changes. Example: **Linked List created using pointers** |
