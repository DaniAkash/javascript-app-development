# Performace considerations

There are 3 places where performance can be increased

1. Network Level
2. Server Level
3. Database Level

## Network Level
At network level we can do the following optimizations.
1. Reduce Number of requests
2. Use CDN's
3. Minification
4. Use Local Caching (see how)

## Server Level
At server level we can do the following optimizations.
1. Scaling
2. Application Optimization (Big Topic)

### Scaling
* vertical scaling
* horizondal scaling

#### vertical scaling
* Buying bigger machine

#### horizondal scaling
* Buying more machines

Advantage of horizondal scaling is there is no limit to the number of servers you can have. But a horizondal scaling cannot buy more than a supercomputer.

### Application Optimization

Why classes are needed : passing variables to a group of functions without using a global variable.
Data Structures : optimized way of storing data

## Database Level

At the database level we can use sharding (splitting) of data
